// This is a Toy Project. I'm not expecting any real use out of this. The purpose is to learn Zig. 
// Following along from "How to write an interpretter in Go" by Thorsten Ball.

// Some thoughts behind the language

// Plan is to write a language to write ops scripts in with easy custom re-usable components.


1. Allow Zig style imports
lib = @import("std");
third_party = @import("github.com/tchaudhry91/somelib");

2. Allow interoperable libs? (e.g pip compat?)
Another idea is to allow CLI tools and work Bash style.

e.g 
curl = @import("system/curl");
stdout, stderr, rc = curl.spawn("https://google.com");

^ Probably better

3. Autogenerate Nix/Docker "executable" scripts.
-> This will require some thought going forward.
-> Ideally, we "spin-up" environments for the plugin to run in via Nix.

4. Environment Vars
env = @import("env");
? Not sure about this.


1st Goal:
Write a "script" that achieves something useful.
